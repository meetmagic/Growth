# Pro Git
## Getting Started
Figure 1-6 helped me understand the local operation flow. Previously I did not have a clearing picture about the status where the file stands everytime I ran git add and git commit, or I modified the file.

⋅⋅⋅* all files are in working directory
    * the files which are added by git add command are in stage area and ready for commit
    * the files will be in git directory once git commit command is ran
