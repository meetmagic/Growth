#Testing Category

I was confused what the difference between the integration testing and the end2end testing when my colleague discussed which type of test a specific test case was. I figured that I need to know the definition of them before I provided any suggestion. I googled it and found some useful articles.

[Just Say No to More End-to-End Tests](https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html) 

[Software Testing Categorization](https://testing.googleblog.com/2009/07/software-testing-categorization.html)

Both of them helped me understand the test categories.
